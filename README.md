# Gift Giver Exemplar Project

Gift giver exemplar project using Node/Express backend

A client has asked you to create an app that operates as a competitor to Elfster. They're a company valued at $6 million that creates gift exchanges for families and friends.

Your client thinks they have a few killer features that could improve on Elfster's design and allow them to compete in the market. But first, they need a backend product to work with. They'd like you to build the prototype using Node and Express.
